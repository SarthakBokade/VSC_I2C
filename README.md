# VSC_I2C
SystemVerilog Design and Verification Of I2C Protocol

This repository implements and verifies the I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol using SystemVerilog. The project includes both the master/slave RTL logic and the associated testbench, along with visual artifacts such as schematics and simulation waveforms.

I²C is a synchronous, half-duplex bus widely used for on-board, short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals using only two bidirectional lines


I²C Protocol Summary

I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a synchronous two-wire serial bus used for connecting multiple devices (master and one or more slaves) on the same lines. It uses:

SDA – Serial Data Line (bidirectional)

SCL – Serial Clock Line (generated by master)

Communication begins with a START condition, followed by address and data bytes, then an ACK/NACK, and ends with a STOP condition.

Design Highlights

RTL implementation of I2C master and slave logic

Bidirectional SDA with start/stop detection

Clock generation and sampling based on SCL1


Verification

The testbench (TB.sv) drives the following:

Clock generation and reset

Master initiating read/write transactions

Slave responding with data and ACK/NACK

Monitoring of SDA/SCL transitions

Simulation outputs are documented in:

I2Cwaveform.png — timing and signal behavior

I2C_console.png — text logs from simulation



Simulation Steps

Run the design and testbench with a SystemVerilog simulator such as ModelSim, Questa, or VCS:

vlog DUT.sv TB.sv
vsim tb
run -all

Check waveforms for proper START/STOP, address match, data transfer, and ACK/NACK sequences.

ACK/NACK handling and address matching

Testbench for protocol-level functional checks
